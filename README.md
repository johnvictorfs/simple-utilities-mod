# END OF LIFE

# Consider using an [Simple Hud Enhanced](https://github.com/SoRadGaming/Simple-HUD-Enhanced) instead

*Adding this notice as of commit `5420a64d12e2738df9669c51b035e47e34876068` for the mod linked above*

**This mod is unlikely to receive future changes and has pending unsolved issues I couldn't get around to fixing/adding.**

The mod linked above has more features and lots of unsolved bugs are already fixed. UX is pretty much the same and any feature it has over this one are toggleable if you want a more minimal experience.

## FAQ

- **Does this Mod work on versions below 1.15?**
    - No. It *might* work on 1.14 with some changes, but cannot work below 1.14, since this mod is made with Fabric, which only supports Minecraft 1.14 and above.

- **Will this Mod get me banned from *(some multiplayer server)*?**
    - It depends on the server you are playing on. This mod runs entirely on the client-side (your computer) and does not support nor require server installation. The mod (mostly) shows things that are accessible through in-game features, such as the F3 Menu. Some features are not directly accessible in the vanilla game, such as very specific game time. Whether these are allowed depends on the server. Do not create issues about this here. Instead, check the rules of the server you intend to use this mod on.

- **Will you add '*(some feature not present in the [Planned Features](#planned-features) section)*'**?
    - Maybe. If it is related to the functionality of this mod, create [an issue](https://github.com/johnvictorfs/simple-utilities-mod/issues/new) about it. I can only add requested features during my spare time, so do not expect a timely response.
